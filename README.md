# Sampling Studio



## Project Description:
### This project is a real-time sampling studio where users can
* Compose their own signal by adding multiple cosinusoidals and the summation signal is plotted automatically

*Note: The default wave name is an auto-incremented number*

* Remove one or more of the added signals

*We removed wave 2* 
* Control the sampling frequency of the signal to see the effects of undersampling and oversampling (default sampling frequency is the Nyquist frequency)

* Upload a signal file (.csv or .xlsx) to sample and reconstruct the signal inside it

* Add noise to the signal and control the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in both composer and uploaded file
